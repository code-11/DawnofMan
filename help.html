        <h3>Overview</h3> 
        <p>Dawn of Man is a simulation of a neolithic village. It is your job as headman of this village to make decisions about its daily runnings. The neolithic era saw humans acquire important skills in surviving in a non-nomadic lifestyle, namely more advanced tool making, agriculture and later irrigation, allowing for the first villages. </p>

        <h5>Next</h5>
        <p>The game is turn based, with each turn lasting somewhere between a week and a month. The turn is advanced by hitting the 'next' button</p>

        <h3>Basic Stocks</h3>
        <p>As headman you are aware of the production of goods in the village. Basic stocks are essentials like food, water and shelter.</p>  
        <p>Although not a stock you can meaningfully influence, elapsed turns (time) is displayed here.</p>

        <div class="help-left">
          <h5>Population</h5>
          <p>Every person requires food, water and shelter each turn. If the population is 50, you should hopefully have more than 50 food, water and shelter. If you do not, your villagers will start to die depending on the lack of the stock.</p>

          <h5>Food</h5>
          <p>Food is collected each turn based on how many people are set to gather food. Villagers will die quickly if there is not enough.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="help-right">
          <h5>Water</h5>
          <p>Water is collected each turn based on how many people are set to gather water. Each person set to this task will gather significantly more than they need, thus providing for others. If water is scarse villagers will also start to die.</p>


          <h5>Shelter</h5>
          <p>Villagers will die if there is not enough, but not as quickly as food or water. Shelters take a short amount of time to construct.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="fatty">Events</h3>
        <p>Reachable through the events tab on the top of the screen, events are notifications, decisions and alerts about the happenings of your village. Some events require you to choose between options. These will usually advance after selecting an option and waiting a number of turns to see how your choice worked out.</p>
        <h5>Military events</h5>
        <p>Some events involve or require military force, probably more than was actually prevalant in the neolithic (depending on location). They are either offensive or defensive, and can be told apart via flavor text.

      <div class="help-right">
        <h3>Alotment</h3> 
        <p> All Alotment tabs allow you to specify an amount of work into different options. The percentages are determined and displayed after you hit the normalize button. </p>

        <h5>Work alotment</h5>
        <p>As headman you get to decide what your citizens do. The Work Alotment tab allows you to determine what percentage of your village will do what. </p>

        <h5>Construction Alotment</h5>
        <p>The Construction Alotment tab allows you to decide what structures your village should build. The amount of work available to build these structures is decided by the construction option of the Work Alotment Tab, so what you select here will be a fraction of a fraction.</p>

        <h5>Food Source</h5>
        <p>The Food Source Tab gives two options for food. Hunting returns more food and provides some military power but increases deaths due to goring by wild animals. Farming is safer but requires water and provides less food. The amount of work available to gather food is decided by the gather food option of the Work Alotment Tab, so what you select here will be a fraction of a fraction.</p>

        <h5>Craftwork</h5>
        <p>The Craftwork Tab divides the work force of the Craft option in the Work Alotment Tab into either tools, weapons or pottery.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Stocks</h3>
        <div class="help-right">
          <h5>Irrigation</h5>
          <p>Permentantly increases the Available water to your village but is hard to make.</p>

          <h5>Fortification</h5>
          <p>Provides a substantial multiplier for defensive events but is hard to make</p>

          <h5>Tools</h5>
          <p> Provides a small multiplier towards construction and crafting. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-left">
          <h5>Weapons</h5>
          <p>Privides a bonus to offensive and defensive events</p>

          <h5>Available Water</h5>
          <p>How much water you can take each turn from the environment</p>

          <h5>Pottery</h5>
          <p>Currently does nothing</p>

          <h5>Military</h5>
          <p>Influences the outcome of events, usually in your favor. People assigned to military still need food, water and shelter.</p>
